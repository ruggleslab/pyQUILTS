In order to generate the .cmp1 files QUILTS uses:

1. Download *chr*.fa.gz files from ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/current_fasta/[your organism]/dna/
(for human GRCh38, ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/current/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/)

2. Run "python prepare_genome.py <path to folder with your .fa.gz files>"

This will create files with a .cmp1 extension, matching the .fa.gz files that were downloaded.

Congratulations, youâ€™ve got your reference genome ready for QUILTS!

You may remove the .fa.gz files once the program runs successfully, and move the .cmp1 files to a folder on your system
where you'd like to store the genome DB.
